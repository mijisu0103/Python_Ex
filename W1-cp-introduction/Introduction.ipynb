    "Well actually... a third way has emerged in recent years, and Python and Java actually sit in this \"grey area\" (though PERL does not). Program code can be translated (i.e. compiled) to an intermediate low-level pseudo-code called *bytecode*. This is the choice made in Java and Python (as well as languages of the Microsoft .NET framework, e.g. C#). The interpreter then only needs to convert bytecode to machine code on the fly, but this is a much simpler task. Thus the first advantage of this approach is *increased speed* relative to interpreted languages (though of course bytecode is still slow compared to native code).\n",
    "\n",
    "A second advantage is *portability*: because bytecode is an abstraction of machine code, it can be made independent of the machine. This has allowed the development of huge standard libraries for languages that use it, a feature that you will find most beneficial.\n",

    "Java bytecode is lower-level (and thus faster) and requires separate programs for generating and running it (the \"compiler\" and a \"virtual machine\" known as JVM), so we commonly think of Java as a \"compiled\" language. Python bytecode (that hides in *.pyc* files) is higher level and is generated and run by the Python interpreter, so we tend to think of Python as an \"interpreted\" language.\n",

    "Object-oriented programming is a technique for facilitating code reuse. It is very popular in industry, though there are arguments against it, as well as in favour. It is essentially an effective way of encapsulating data and code in independent units (known as *objects*) that can be handled without any knowledge of their internal working and modified according to your needs. **Objects** are a more advanced concept than *modules* or *functions* (both of which we will cover), and offer exciting capabilities such as inheritance (in fact, object-oriented libraries are organised in taxonomies of sorts). This obviously imposes some overhead, especially evident in languages like Java (where object-oriented programming is mandatory). \n",

    "The good news is: Python is object-oriented, but you can safely ignore objects if they are not useful for your task (e.g. short scripts). When you do want to use them, the overhead is minimal and the mechanism is rather elegant. By contrast, objects come as an afterthought to PERL and are not very convenient to use.\n",
