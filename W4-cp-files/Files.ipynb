    "\n",
    "**Text files** can be opened and modified with a plain text editor such as gedit, emacs or notepad. They are not necessarily written in plan English: a Python program, an [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) page,  a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) file, an [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) file, a [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file, a [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) file or a [PDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank_(file_format)) file are all text files. While not always meant for human consumption, text files are generally somewhat human-readable and are portable across different operating systems and editors, with very minor niggles. The disadvantage is that they take up a lot of space on the disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary files** contain data in the internal machine representation. They are less portable and are generally used either to talk directly to the machine, or to store large amounts of data efficiently, or to protect intellectual property. Python bytecode (.pyc) files, compressed (.zip) files, Microsoft Word (.doc) files, executable files (.exe on Windows systems), image files (.jpg, .gif), and music files (.wav, .mp3) are all examples of binary files. An attempt at opening them in a text editor will only show gibberish on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happily many of the file types used in web programming, bioinformatics and other fields are text files with open format specifications, so we will not worry about binary files here (specialised libraries exist for the most common file types anyway). It is important however to remember, in your future professional life, that sometimes what you really need is not a bigger disk, but  only a more compact data representation.\n"
